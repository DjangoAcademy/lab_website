      <h2>About</h2>
      <dl style="margin-bottom:10px">
        <dd>The Ocean Remote Sensing Group at Old Dominion University studies a wide range of research topics including sea level rise, ocean/climate variability, natural hazards and climate change. <br>
            The primary focus is on the use of satellite remote sensing to improve our understanding of the ocean in the past, present and future. <br>
            While the group is part of the Ocean, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Department at ODU, our expertise extends beyond oceanography to include aerospace, civil and mechanical engineering and applied mathematics.
