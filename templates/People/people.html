      <p>Ben Hamlington is an assistant professor in the Ocean, Earth, and Atmospheric Sciences Department at Old Dominion University. Prior to arriving at ODU, Ben obtained his BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis, and his PhD in Aerospace Engineering Sciences from the University of Colorado at Boulder. His primary research interest is on past, present and future sea level rise, focusing on the use of satellite observations to improve our understanding of the ocean. Beyond studying sea level, Ben does research on a wide range of topics including ENSO/climate variability, tsunamis, wildfires, and land subsidence.</p>

      <p>Se-Hyeon Cheon has been at ODU as a visiting scholar since Nov 2014. He is a PhD student in Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of Seoul National University in South Korea. His specific major is Coastal and Harbor Engineering and his masterâ€™s thesis was about the development of numerical model for 2-dimentional sediment transports. Now, he is conducting research with Dr. Benjamin Hamlington to predict climate change impacts on wave condition around the Korean Peninsul applying CSEOF (Cyclo-Stationary Empirical Orthogonal Function) analysis.</p>

      <p>My research interests include: climate change, sea level rise, circulation, modeling, bio-physical interactions, and applied mathematics. I enjoy work that is interdisciplinary where I can work with a variety of people on projects that include both observational work and modeling. I am currently working on developing estimating factors effecting sea level change and an index on regional sea level rise. I completed two bachelor of science degrees from California State University Monterey Bay in mathematics (2015) and environmental science, technology and, policy (2015), and received a master of science degree in oceanography from Old Dominion University (2017). I am enjoying living on a new coast and learning about coastal processes and different ecosystems that exist here in Virginia. Some of my personal hobbies include playing in a wind ensemble, competing in triathlons, and participating in community outreach and service.</p>
